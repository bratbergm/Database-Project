**Plans for testing**

After I have created a basic, fundamental setup, and have successfully implemented end-to-end
functionallity for a simple task, I will start developing tests.

I plan on creating unit tests before starting on the code itself. This will allow me to test while 
developing, and it will help me better understand what I want the code to do.

I will implement tests for the functionalities that are described in the project case.
